# Action runners deployment default example

This module shows how to create GitHub action runners that run on ubuntu on EC2.

## Usages

Steps for the full setup, such as creating a GitHub app can be found in the root module's [README](../../README.md).

This is designed to be "It just works" wrapper, if you want more configuration, the [philips module](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philips-labs/terraform-aws-github-runner) is probably a better
fit.
